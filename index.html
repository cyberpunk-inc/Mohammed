        <h2>My Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
        <p>As I embark on my journey in the tech field, I have set several ambitious goals to achieve over the next two years. Here are my primary objectives:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Master Frontend Development</h3>
                <p>Over the next year, I aim to become proficient in frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with popular frameworks like ReactJS. I will focus on building responsive, user-friendly web applications and continually improve my skills through practice and real-world projects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Learn Backend Development</h3>
                <p>In my second year, I plan to expand my knowledge to backend development. This includes learning server-side languages such as Node.js and Python, understanding databases like MongoDB and SQL, and becoming familiar with RESTful API development. My goal is to become a full-stack developer capable of handling both frontend and backend tasks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Contribute to Open Source Projects</h3>
                <p>I believe that contributing to open source projects is a great way to learn and give back to the community. Over the next two years, I will actively participate in open source projects, collaborate with other developers, and contribute to meaningful projects that solve real-world problems.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Build a Strong Portfolio</h3>
                <p>Throughout this journey, I will focus on building a strong portfolio that showcases my skills and projects. This will include personal projects, contributions to open source, and any freelance work I undertake. A well-rounded portfolio will help me in securing job opportunities and advancing my career in the tech industry.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Continuous Learning and Networking</h3>
                <p>The tech industry is constantly evolving, and continuous learning is essential. I will regularly participate in online courses, attend workshops, and join tech communities to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies. Networking with other professionals will also be a key focus, as it opens up opportunities for collaboration and growth.</p>
